Cant edit owner address - I get an error

Cant delete service , get an error saying need to be unique

Refresh a list after deleting values

How to display the Details or Coresponding attributes accoording to a giivenn ID. Ex- Service Table ;- Instead of having to pick a number 
would be better if i could display the make and model of the car allong with the owner of it and the service description. 
need to apply for :- Servicetypeequip form, service form,etc




Note: When I tried to give display member/ value member to combobox it gives an issue when selecting an object



Where can i find code to make a custom view (data fields from differenct tables put into one table)
